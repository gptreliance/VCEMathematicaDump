# VCEMathematicaDump
Comprehensive Mathematica Cheat Sheets for the Victorian Curriculum

(Victorian Curriculum means only a couple of schools, including Wodonga and John Monash)

Welcome here! This is a megaproject I am embarking to recoup the lost mathematica knowledge I have neglected to learn! Therefore, your edit requests will be IGNORED until the year 10, 11 and 12 files are COMPLETELY FINISHED.

--Currently not finished, requests will be IGNORED--

If this project is successful, I might consider consolidating all the commands onto a single file and work on a Specialist Maths worksheet PURELY for the sake of practice (I don't do specialist xD)
